###Easy Setup


(If you aren't familiar with the new view controller transitioning API, it's best to start here: http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/custom-uiviewcontroller-transitions/)

`SMLBookshelfTransitionAnimator` provides sensible defaults, you really only need to provide it with views for the left and right sides!

    SMLBookshelfTransitionAnimator *animator = [[SMLBookshelfTransitionAnimator alloc] init];
    animator.leftView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"left.jpg"]];
    animator.rightView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"right.jpg"]];
    

###Options

Duration, depth, perspective and rotation direction are all customizable options

Because we often create one off animator instances for presenting and dismissing view controllers, a couple of conveniences for automatically swapping the left and right sides are also provided to help aid in the appearance of a seamless, stateful, 3D transition.

###Left, Right, Front, Back

_TLDR; Always set the `dismissing` property when dismissing a view controller._

By default all directional properties of `SMLBookshelfTransitionAnimator` (`leftView`, `rightView`, `rotationDirection`) are interpreted from the perspective of the front view. The `leftView` is the side _to the left_ of the front view, the `rightView` is the side _to the right_ of the front view. When rotating, `SMLBookshelfTransitionLeft` rotates _toward_ the left -- that is, the left side will push away from the viewer as the right side rotates toward the viewer.

**Front is relative**! This can be tricky â€¦ by default, `SMLBookshelfTransitionAnimator` is intended to be instantiated once for presenting a view controller and again for dismissing it - this cuts down on the need to maintain a bunch of state across your view controllers just so you can have some pretty animations. Because of this, while setting the `dismissing` property is optional, it is also _highly_ recommended.

When the `dismissing` property is set, the `leftView` and `rightView` values are swapped. This means that it is then only necessary to think about directionality from the perspective of the _presenting_ view controller. With this approach, a single convenience method can generate `SMLBookshelfTransitionAnimator` instances with no need to juggle properties based on presentation state; we'll handle the juggling for you.

Take a look at the sample app to see how we're handling this there. I think you'll find the code to be much tidier this way.
